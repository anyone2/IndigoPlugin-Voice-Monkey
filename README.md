# IndigoPlugin-Voice-Monkey
 This script utilizes the Amazon Voice Monkey APIs  to control your Alexa devices

 The plugin, Voice Monkey, allows you to control your Alexa devices from within Indigo. It works with the Voice Monkey Amazon Alexa skill which has the ability to perform text-to-speech, play preset sounds, and execute Alexa routines on an Alexa Smart device such as an Echo or Echo Dot.

The Voice Monkey capabilities that the plugin supports are:

- Execute an Alexa Routine
- Perform Text-To-Speech
- Play a preset sound (Chime, Doorbell, Air Horn, etc.)
- Play a URL audio file (Dogs barking, etc.)
- Play a URL audio file (Dogs barking, etc.) while performing Text-To-Speech
- Ask a Prompted Yes/No Question, executing an Action Group based on the Yes, No, or No Response. (the Alexa Plugin is a requirement)

All of these are "Pro" features of the Amazon Alexa Skill except for the ability to Execute an Alexa Routine. The "Pro" features, by the way, are $6 per year.

With the non-Pro feature (singular), you are limited to, if you want to call it a limit, triggering Alexa routines. 

I shared some information about this skill last year in this thread: [https://forums.indigodomo.com/viewtopic.php?f=138&t=25958](https://forums.indigodomo.com/viewtopic.php?f=138&t=25958)
